    <title>Determine offspring sex based on genes XX and XY chromosomes</title>

    <p>
        The male gametes or sperm cells in humans and other mammals are heterogametic and contain one of <br>
        two types of sex chromosomes. They are either X or Y. The female gametes or eggs however, contain <br>
        only the X sex chromosome and are homogametic.<br>
        <br>
        The sperm cell determines the sex of an individual in this case. If a sperm cell containing an X <br>
        chromosome fertilizes an egg, the resulting zygote will be XX or female. If the sperm cell contains <br>
        a Y chromosome, then the resulting zygote will be XY or male.<br>
        <br>
        Determine if the sex of the offspring will be male or female based on the X or Y chromosome present <br>
        in the male's sperm.<br>
        <br>
        If the sperm contains the X chromosome, return "Congratulations! You're going to have a daughter."; <br>
        If the sperm contains the Y chromosome, return "Congratulations! You're going to have a son.";<br>
